# Luhn-Algorithm-with-HQL

This repository was created to share the Luhn algorithm created using only HQL (Hive Query Language), known as SQL from Hive.

I received this challenge from a demand at work, but I could not find any material on the internet. In this way, I am sharing my solution and I hope it could be useful for other people someday.
